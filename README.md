Okay so setting up this is easy. But first this was a rushed one-week project admist doing other things. Aesthetics and some other things are not so fantatsic.

It has two components, the electron app which actually houses a react frontend, and a django backend in the django-app folder

First, create a virtual environment named venv in the django-app folder. You can then install all the django/python requirements with the requirements.txt file.

The reason why I specified the name of the virtual env is because the electron/react frontend, using a bash command, starts the django server automatically with a hard-coded path. I'm sorry I didn't find a better way. The hard coded path can be found in the main.js file (the electron main process) under public.

So you don't need to start the django server independently. After npm installing all the necessary react/electron packages with the package.json, just run **npm run electron:serve** and the electron/react frontend will start itself and also kick start the django backend within the virtual environment named venv directly in the django-app folder

The user reg is with email n pass. I overrode Django's user moodel for that. **Email confirmation with token is such that the email gets sent to a file in the project folder named emails**. I was testing and so did not set up an email for this purpose, hence the file-based testing approach.

In case you just wanna dive in without registration. I created a sample user in the uploaded sqlite db
email: karmatest@gmail.com
pass: karma007

THANK YOU !!






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
